Customer: Hi FitApp Support Team,
I noticed that I was charged twice for my FitApp subscription on March 5, 2025. There are two identical $9.99 charges on my credit card statement for that date, but I only have one account and one subscription. This seems like a mistake on your end. Could you please look into this and refund the extra charge? Thank you,
Jane Support: Hello Jane, Thank you for bringing this to our attention. I'm sorry for the double charge on March 5. I've checked our billing system and confirmed the duplicate payment. We have processed a refund of $9.99 back to your credit card, and you should see the refund appear within 5–7 business days. The double billing was caused by a temporary glitch with our payment processor, and we've corrected it to prevent future issues. We apologize for the inconvenience. Please let us know if you need any further assistance. Sincerely,
Michael

Customer: Hello, I canceled my subscription last month via the app, but I was still charged on April 1, 2025. I have a $59.99 charge on my Visa even though I turned off auto-renew on March 28. This is really frustrating. I would like a full refund and confirmation that my account is actually canceled. Thanks,
Mark Support: Hi Mark, I apologize for the confusion and inconvenience. I see in our records that you initiated a cancellation on March 28, 2025, but unfortunately the annual renewal had already processed on April 1. I've canceled your subscription effective immediately and issued a full $59.99 refund. You should see the refund on your Visa in 5–7 business days. Rest assured, your account is now reverted to the free Basic plan and you will not be charged again. You will no longer have access to premium features as of today, given the refund and cancellation. Please let me know if you have any other questions or if there's anything else I can assist you with. Regards,

Customer: Hi, I accidentally subscribed to the annual plan and got charged $59.99 yesterday. I intended to use the free trial first, but my daughter was playing with my phone and seems to have confirmed the purchase. This was on my iPhone through the App Store. I have not used the Premium features at all yet. Can I please get a refund for this accidental purchase? Thank you,
Emily Support: Hello Emily, I’m sorry to hear about the accidental purchase. Because the subscription was processed through Apple’s App Store, we unfortunately cannot issue a refund directly on our end. However, you can request a refund from Apple. Here are the steps you can follow:
Open the Apple App Store on your iPhone and tap on your profile icon.
Go to Purchase History and find the FitApp subscription purchase from April 9, 2025.
Tap Report a Problem and select Request a Refund, then explain that the purchase was accidental.
Apple typically processes refund requests within a few days. I've also canceled your FitApp Premium subscription effective immediately to prevent any further charges. You can continue using the free trial as intended. If you run into any issues with the refund process, let us know and we’ll do our best to assist. Sincerely,
Alex

Customer: Hi, I’m currently on the monthly Premium plan for $9.99, and I’d like to upgrade to the annual plan to save money. What’s the process to switch from monthly to annual? Will I be charged right away for the annual plan, or will it start after my current month is over? Thanks,
Ryan Support: Hello Ryan, Great to hear that you want to switch to the annual plan! You can upgrade from monthly to annual easily within the app. Here’s how:
Open the FitApp and go to Settings > Subscription.
Select the Annual Premium Plan ($59.99/year) option.
Confirm the purchase when prompted.
When you switch plans, the system will credit you for the remaining days of your current monthly cycle. In practice, you’ll be charged $59.99 minus a pro-rated amount for the unused portion of this month. Your new annual subscription will begin immediately, and your renewal date will reset to one year from now (so you won’t be billed $9.99 again this month). All your account data and settings will remain intact; the only change is the billing schedule. If you run into any trouble during the upgrade, please let us know. Enjoy the savings and thank you for being a Premium member! Best regards,
Lena

Customer: Hello, I’m currently a Premium subscriber, but I’d like to downgrade to the free Basic plan due to budget constraints. My next monthly renewal is on May 15, 2025. How can I cancel my Premium subscription so it doesn’t renew, and will I lose any of my workout data or plans when I go back to the free version? Sincerely,
Carlos Support: Hi Carlos, We understand that you’d like to switch back to the Basic plan. To downgrade (cancel your Premium auto-renewal), you can follow these steps:
If you subscribed via our website or Android app: Log in to your account, go to Settings > Subscription, and click Cancel Subscription. This will stop the auto-renew.
If you subscribed through the iOS App Store: Open your iPhone’s Settings, tap your Apple ID > Subscriptions, find FitApp, and select Cancel Subscription.
Once canceled, you’ll continue to have Premium access until May 15, 2025, since you’ve already paid up to that date. After that, your account will revert to the Basic free version. Don’t worry, you won’t lose your workout history or personal data. All your logged workouts and progress will remain saved; you’ll just lose access to Premium features like advanced analytics or personalized coaching until you re-subscribe. If you need any help with the cancellation process or have more questions, feel free to reach out. Thank you for trying Premium, and we hope to see you back again in the future! Best,

Customer: Hi, I forgot my FitApp password and tried to reset it, but I'm not receiving the password reset email. I checked my spam folder and nothing is there. My account email is alice.jones@example.com. Could you help me get back into my account? Thanks,
Alice Support: Hello Alice, I'm sorry you're having trouble resetting your password. I have checked our system for your account (alice.jones@example.com). The reset emails were sent at 10:15 AM and 10:30 AM today, but it appears they might be getting blocked before reaching your inbox. Sometimes our emails can be filtered out by certain email providers. To resolve this, please try the following:
Add no-reply@fitapp.com to your email account’s contacts or safe senders list.
After that, go to the FitApp login screen and tap “Forgot Password” again to trigger a new reset email.
If you still do not see the email within a few minutes, check any "Promotions" or "Junk" subfolders just in case.
As an alternative, I have generated a temporary password for you: TempFit123. You can use this to log in, and once you’re in, please go to Settings > Account to set a new secure password of your choice. (For your security, this temporary password will expire in 24 hours.) Let me know if you continue to have any issues accessing your account. We're here to help! Best regards,

Customer: Hi Support, I'm unable to log in to my FitApp account even though I’m entering the correct password. I even reset my password twice, and it still says “Incorrect email or password” every time on the app. My email is d.smith99@gmail.com. Is there something wrong with my account?
David
Support: Hello David, I'm sorry you're experiencing this login problem. Since you've already tried resetting your password and are still getting the "Incorrect email or password" message, we need to troubleshoot further. A few things could be happening:
Typos or extra spaces: Double-check that your email is entered correctly (no typos) and that there are no extra spaces before or after the email or password when you enter them.
Account via Google/Apple Sign-In: Our records show that your email d.smith99@gmail.com is linked to a FitApp account created using Google Sign-In. This means a password won’t work on that account because it authenticates through Google. If this is the case, please tap “Sign in with Google” on the login screen (instead of entering a password).
Account Status: I’ve verified that your account is active and there are no locks on it.
If you prefer to use a password instead of Google Sign-In going forward, you can set one by logging in via Google on our website and then visiting the Account Settings to create a password. Otherwise, continuing with the Google option should resolve the login issue on your phone. Please let me know if you're still unable to access your account after trying the above. I'm here to help get you back on track. Sincerely,
Irene

Customer: Hello, I would like to permanently delete my FitApp account and all of my data. I’ve switched to a different service and no longer need this account. My username is SamanthaClark88. Please assist with deleting my account. Thank you,
Samantha Clark Support: Hi Samantha, I'm sorry to see you go. We can certainly handle the deletion of your account. Just to confirm, deleting your account will erase all your workout history, personal training plans, and nutritional data from our servers, and this action cannot be undone. If you’re sure you want to proceed, please reply to this email confirming that you’d like us to delete your account. For security, we need this written confirmation. Once we have that, we'll process the deletion and send you a confirmation when it's completed. Regards,
Tyler
FitApp Support Team Customer: Hi Tyler, yes, I confirm that I want to permanently delete my account and all data associated with it. I understand it’s irreversible. Please proceed. Sincerely,
Samantha Support: Hello Samantha, Thank you for confirming. I've initiated the deletion process for your account SamanthaClark88. Your data will be permanently erased from our servers within 24 hours. Once the deletion is finalized, you'll receive an automated confirmation email. We're sorry to see you leave FitApp. If you ever decide to return, you’ll need to create a new account, as all data associated with this account will be gone. If there's anything else we can do for you in the meantime, please let us know. We wish you all the best in your fitness journey. Sincerely,

Customer: Hi, I'm having trouble syncing my FitApp data across devices. I use the app on my Android phone and on my iPad. I logged five workouts this week on my phone, but when I open the app on my iPad, none of those workouts show up. Both devices are connected to the internet. I'm logged in on both, so I'm not sure why the data isn't syncing. It's really frustrating that my workout history is incomplete on my tablet. Regards,
Nikhil Support: Hello Nikhil, I'm sorry you're experiencing syncing issues. Your workout data should indeed sync automatically across devices. Let's try to figure out what's happening. One common issue is when two different accounts are inadvertently created (for example, using an email login on one device and a social login on another). Could you confirm:
The email/username you use to log in on your Android phone.
The email/Apple ID you use on your iPad (if you use Sign in with Apple on the iPad app, it might have created a separate account).
From our end, I see an account under your name associated with nikhil@example.com, and another account via Apple ID (which looks like an anonymized email ending in @privaterelay.appleid.com). This suggests the iPad might be logged into a separate account. If that's the case, the solution would be to decide which account you want to keep using. If all your recent workout history is on the Android (nikhil@example.com) account, you can log out on the iPad and then log back in using the same email (nikhil@example.com) and your password. That should bring all your logged workouts into the iPad app. Alternatively, if you prefer using Apple sign-in, we could transfer the recent workouts from the email account to the Apple-linked account manually on our end. Let me know which you prefer, and we'll assist accordingly. Best,
Dana
FitApp Support Team Customer: Hi Dana, you’re right—I had originally made my account with email (nikhil@example.com) on my phone, but on the iPad I think I used the "Sign in with Apple" option without realizing it was a separate account. I want to keep the email account (nikhil@example.com) since that has all my history. I’ll log out on the iPad and log back in with my email and password. Could you help me transfer the one workout I logged on the iPad (I did record one there) over to my main account, or should I just add it manually? Thanks for the help,
Nikhil Support: Hi Nikhil, Thanks for confirming. The easiest solution is as you planned: log out of the Apple-based account on your iPad and then log back in using your nikhil@example.com credentials. That will sync all the workouts from your main account to the iPad. Regarding the one workout you logged on the iPad’s Apple-linked account: I've gone ahead and added that missing workout (from April 7, 2025) to your nikhil@example.com account manually. So you should see that entry when you log in on your phone or iPad now. I've also deleted the empty Apple-linked account to avoid future confusion. Everything should be in order now. Please let me know if all your workouts are appearing correctly on both devices after you log in on the iPad. If you encounter any more syncing issues, we’ll be here to help. Cheers,
Dana

Customer: Hello, I was wondering if FitApp can sync with Apple Health. I turned on the “Connect to Apple Health” option in the app, but my FitApp workouts aren’t showing up in the Apple Health app. For example, my 5km run from yesterday isn’t appearing in Health’s activity log. I'm on an iPhone 14 with iOS 16.4 and FitApp version 3.5. Could you help me get this working? Thanks,
Ming Support: Hi Ming, Yes, FitApp is designed to integrate with Apple Health, so your issue might be related to permissions. Let’s make sure everything is set correctly:
Open your iPhone Settings and go to Health > Data Access & Devices.
Find FitApp in the list of apps and tap it.
Ensure that all the categories you want to share (Workouts, Active Energy, etc.) are enabled. For example, toggle Workouts to on, so FitApp has permission to write your workout data to Apple Health.
After confirming, open FitApp and in Settings > Integrations, make sure Apple Health integration is toggled on as well.
Once those permissions are set, newly logged workouts in FitApp should appear in Apple Health within a few minutes. Note that past workouts (like yesterday’s run) might not sync retroactively until you re-save them. You can try opening yesterday’s run entry in FitApp and tapping “Save” again, which sometimes prompts a sync. If you have done all the above and still don't see the data in Apple Health, let me know. We may need to troubleshoot further, but in most cases adjusting the permissions resolves the issue. Best,
Ava

Customer: Hi, I love using FitApp so far! Do you have any plans to release an Apple Watch app for it? I’d love to be able to start a workout and see my heart rate and calories on my Apple Watch while exercising, and maybe get notifications for sets/rest on the watch. It would make things so much more convenient. Thanks,
Jenny Support: Hello Jenny, Thank you for the kind words and for the great suggestion! An Apple Watch companion app is actually one of our most requested features, and I’m happy to say it’s on our development roadmap. In fact, our team has started working on an Apple Watch integration that will allow you to:
Start/stop tracking workouts from your Watch.
View real-time stats like heart rate and calories on the Watch screen.
Receive workout reminders and rest period timers via haptic alerts.
We don’t have an exact release date yet, but it’s tentatively planned for later this year (we’ll announce it via email and in the app once it’s ready). In the meantime, some users pair FitApp with Apple Health so that workout data from FitApp can be viewed in the Health app on the Watch, but we know that’s not the same as a native watch app. We appreciate your patience and enthusiasm. Stay tuned for updates! If you have any other suggestions or questions, feel free to let us know. Best regards,
Marcus

Customer: Hello, I have a quick suggestion for the FitApp team. Could you please consider adding a dark mode to the app? I often exercise in the evenings, and the white background of the app is quite bright when I check my workout plan or log meals at night. A dark mode would be much easier on the eyes (and it would look really cool too!). Thanks for the great app,
Leo Support: Hi Leo, Thanks for your suggestion! You’re not alone—dark mode is a popular request from our users, and we completely understand the benefits of having a darker interface for low-light conditions. The good news is our developers have been actively working on a dark mode feature. We expect to launch dark mode in one of the upcoming app updates. It will allow you to switch to a black/gray theme that's easier on the eyes at night. I don’t have an exact timeline, but it's coming soon (likely within the next couple of months). We appreciate your feedback and are glad you’re enjoying FitApp. If you have any more ideas or need help with anything, we're all ears! Sincerely,
Priya

Customer: Hi, the FitApp app has been crashing on startup ever since I updated it yesterday. I'm using a Samsung Galaxy S21 running Android 13. The app was fine before, but now every time I tap it, I see the logo for a second and then it crashes back to my home screen. I’ve tried restarting my phone, but that didn’t help. Is this a known issue with the latest update (v4.2.1)? I can't use the app at all right now, which is super frustrating. – Michael Support: Hello Michael, I'm really sorry about the crash issue – that’s certainly frustrating. We have received a few similar reports from other Android users on v4.2.1, particularly on Samsung devices. It appears there’s a bug in the latest update causing the app to crash on startup for some models. Our development team is working on a fix and plans to release a patch (v4.2.2) within the next 24-48 hours. In the meantime, here are a couple of things you can try:
Clear cache: Go to Settings > Apps > FitApp on your phone and tap Force Stop, then Storage > Clear Cache. Try launching the app again.
Reinstall the app: If clearing the cache doesn't help, uninstall FitApp and reinstall it from the Google Play Store. Your data is stored in the cloud, so once you log back in, your workouts and plans will re-sync.
If those steps don’t work, you might need to wait for the patched update. I know that’s not ideal, but rest assured the fix is our top priority and is being expedited. As a courtesy for the inconvenience, I've added a free week of Premium to your account. Thank you for your patience. We’ll notify you via the Play Store as soon as the update is live. Please let me know if you have any questions or if the issue persists after trying the above. Sincerely,
Sara

Customer: Hi, I'm experiencing a bug with the nutrition tracker in FitApp. I log my meals and calories throughout the day, but the next day, some of the entries are gone. For example, I logged all my meals yesterday (April 9th) and saw a total of 1,800 calories, but when I opened the app this morning (April 10th), my dinner entry was missing and the total dropped. This has happened a couple of times now. I'm using FitApp v3.9 on an iPhone 12 (iOS 16.3). Can you help? Thanks,
Fatima Support: Hi Fatima, Thank you for reporting this issue, and I'm sorry you're dealing with disappearing meal entries. That definitely should not be happening. We have identified a bug in FitApp v3.9 affecting some iOS users where the last logged meal of the day isn't properly saved under certain conditions (like if the app is closed too quickly after logging). The good news is our developers have fixed this bug in our internal build. We plan to release an update (v3.9.1) within the next few days to resolve this. In the meantime, a workaround that might help is to keep the app open for a few seconds after logging your final meal of the day, to ensure it syncs to our server. Also, try pulling down on the Nutrition screen to force a data sync after adding an entry. I know that's not ideal, but the fix is coming very soon. Once you update to 3.9.1, you shouldn't experience this issue anymore. If you like, I can email you as soon as the update is live. We apologize for the inconvenience—keeping an accurate log is important, and we want to make sure FitApp serves you well. If you notice anything else or have questions, please let me know. Best regards,

Customer: Hello, I think I found a bug in how FitApp handles unit conversions. I prefer using kilograms and kilometers, so I set my units to metric in the app. However, on the Progress > Weight screen, when I enter my weight as 70 kg, it shows up as 154 lbs, which is fine, but on another screen (the profile overview) it displays as 152 lbs. It seems like there’s an inconsistent conversion or rounding issue. 70 kg should be about 154.3 lbs, so I'm not sure why one part of the app shows 152. Could you look into this? Regards,
Oliver Support: Hi Oliver, Thank you for pointing that out – unit consistency is important. It does sound like you’ve uncovered a conversion/rounding bug. The profile overview might be rounding differently than the progress screen. Specifically, 70 kg is approximately 154.32 lbs:
One part of the app appears to be rounding down to 152 lbs (which is clearly off by a couple of pounds).
Another part shows 154 lbs, which is the correct rounded value.
I've logged this issue for our development team. They will investigate why the profile overview is miscalculating the conversion. It could be using an outdated formula or misreading the units setting. We aim to fix this in the next update so all sections of the app consistently use the same conversion and rounding. In the meantime, rest assured your data is stored correctly as 70 kg on our servers – it’s just a display issue. Thank you for letting us know about this. We appreciate your attention to detail! If you notice any other inconsistencies or have further questions, please feel free to reach out. Sincerely,
Nina

Customer: Hi, I signed up for the 14-day free trial and it ended yesterday. I just saw a charge on my credit card for $59.99 for an annual subscription, which I did not intend to purchase. I forgot to cancel before the trial ended (honestly, I didn’t realize it would automatically convert without a reminder). I do not want the annual subscription. Can you please refund this charge and cancel the subscription? I haven’t used the app since the trial ended.
Natalie
Support: Hello Natalie, I apologize for the confusion. We do send a reminder email 3 days before the trial expires, but I understand it can be missed. I completely understand that you didn’t intend to continue with a paid plan. I have canceled your subscription and processed a full $59.99 refund for the annual charge. The refund was initiated today (April 12, 2025) and should appear back on your card within 5–7 business days. In the meantime, your account has been reverted to the free Basic version, and you will not be charged going forward. We're sorry that FitApp didn’t meet your needs at this time. If you decide to give us another try in the future, you can always restart a subscription (and we occasionally offer promotions that might be of interest). If you have any other questions or concerns, please let me know. I'm here to help. Sincerely,
Devon

Customer: Hello, my free trial just ended yesterday and the app reverted to the free version. I'm ready to subscribe because I really liked the features. When I go to the subscription page, it offers monthly vs annual – if I subscribe, will all my previous progress and my custom workout plan from the trial still be there? I want to make sure I don't lose anything when switching from trial to paid. Also, is there a way to use a different payment method than the one I used for the trial? Thank you,
Anita Support: Hi Anita, That’s great to hear you enjoyed the trial and want to continue with FitApp! Your progress and custom workout plan are saved to your account, so even though the trial ended, nothing is lost. Once you subscribe to a paid plan (monthly or annual), all those Premium features and your plan will unlock again exactly where you left off. To subscribe:
Open FitApp and navigate to Settings > Upgrade (or the subscription banner on the dashboard).
Choose between Monthly ($9.99/month) or Annual ($59.99/year).
If you're on iOS and want to use a different payment method than what was on file, you'll need to update your App Store payment method (via your Apple ID settings) before subscribing. On Android or our website, you can simply enter a new card or select PayPal during checkout.
Follow the prompts to confirm the purchase.
Once done, restart the app (if it doesn't automatically refresh), and you’ll have full Premium access again. All your workout history, custom plan, and data will be there as before. If you run into any issues during subscription or have any other questions, just let us know. We're excited to have you on board as a subscriber! Best,
Brian

Customer: Hi, I received a promo code "SAVE20" for 20% off the annual subscription, but when I try to apply it, it doesn't seem to work. I entered it on the payment screen for the annual plan (original price $59.99) and the price still shows $59.99 instead of a discount. The code is supposed to be valid until April 30, and I’m applying it before that date. Can you help apply this discount? Thanks,
Olivia Support: Hello Olivia, I'm sorry that the promo code isn't applying as expected. Let's sort this out. I’ve checked the code "SAVE20" in our system, and it is indeed active until April 30, 2025 for a 20% discount on the annual plan. A couple of things could be happening:
The promo code field is case-sensitive. Please make sure you're entering it as SAVE20 (all caps, no spaces).
If you're on iOS, the App Store doesn't support our promo codes directly in the app. In that case, you would need to redeem the discount through our website. You can log in to your account at fitapp.com and apply the code during checkout for the annual plan. Once you complete the purchase on the website, your app will recognize the subscription.
As a quick resolution, I can also apply the discount to your account manually. If you prefer, I can generate a custom link for you that already has the 20% off applied. Let me know which option works best for you. We want to make sure you get the promised discount. Please try the above and inform me if it still doesn’t work – I'll make sure you get the 20% off one way or another! Best regards,
Kevin

Customer: Hello, I'm very interested in FitApp Premium, but as a college student my budget is tight. The $15 per month is a bit steep for me. Do you offer any student discounts or maybe a scholarship program for the subscription? I’d really love to use the app long-term if it were a bit more affordable. Thank you,
Ethan Support: Hi Ethan, Thank you for reaching out and for your interest in FitApp Premium. We totally understand budget constraints for students. While we don't have an official student discount program at the moment, we do occasionally run promotions and discounts. In fact, we have a Spring promotion coming up next week where the annual plan will be 30% off (bringing it down to roughly $6.99/month equivalent). You might consider that option since it significantly lowers the monthly cost. Additionally, as a one-time courtesy, I can offer you a promo code right now for 20% off the first three months of a monthly subscription, if you prefer to go monthly and pay as you go. Here’s the promo code you can use: STUDENT20. It will reduce the monthly price for the next quarter. To use it, just enter it on the subscription checkout page in the app or website. I hope this helps! We appreciate you considering FitApp to aid your fitness journey. If you have any other questions or need assistance, please let us know. Best,

Customer: Hi, I'm trying to subscribe to FitApp Premium but the payment keeps failing. I tried two different credit cards that both have available funds, so I'm not sure why it's not going through. I'm on the Android app – after I enter my card details and hit subscribe, it gives an error saying "Payment authorization failed." Is there an issue with your payment system today, or what can I do to resolve this? Thanks,
Andre Support: Hello Andre, I'm sorry you're having trouble subscribing. There are a few reasons a payment might fail even if your cards are in good standing. Let's troubleshoot:
Card verification: Sometimes the bank might block the charge thinking it's unusual. Since this is an online recurring subscription, you might want to call your bank and ensure they aren’t flagging the transaction.
Billing details: Double-check that the ZIP/postal code and address you entered match what's on file for your credit card. A mismatch can cause authorization to fail.
Try an alternate method: If possible, you could try using a different payment method such as PayPal (our Android app supports PayPal payments). This sometimes bypasses card issues.
No known outage: We haven’t had reports of system-wide payment issues today, and I see other transactions going through, so it appears to be an isolated case.
One thing to note: since you attempted multiple times, your bank might have multiple pending authorizations. These usually drop off if the charges didn't go through (you won't be charged multiple times). Please try the above suggestions. If it still fails, let us know and we can further investigate or even arrange an alternate way to get you set up with Premium. We want to make sure you can join without too much hassle. Sorry for the inconvenience – we appreciate your patience. Let me know how it goes or if you need further assistance. Best regards,

Customer: Hi, my credit card on file for FitApp is expiring soon and I need to update it to a new card to ensure my subscription renews next month. I’m on an annual plan that renews July 5, 2025. How can I change the payment details for my subscription? I subscribed through your website originally (not via App Store). Also, will updating the card charge me immediately or only when the renewal date comes? Thanks,
Greg Support: Hi Greg, Keeping your payment info up-to-date is important, and we can definitely help with that. Since you subscribed through our website, you can update your credit card by following these steps:
Log in to your account on the FitApp website.
Navigate to Settings > Billing Information (or Subscription section).
There you should see an option to update or add a new payment method. Enter your new credit card details and save.
Updating the card now will not trigger an immediate charge. It will simply store the new card for the next renewal on July 5, 2025. Your current subscription period is already paid up until that date, so the new card will be charged on July 5 when your annual plan renews. After updating, I recommend double-checking that the new card appears as the active payment method. You should also receive an email confirmation from us that your billing information was updated. If you run into any trouble updating the card, or if you have any more questions, please let me know. I'm here to help! Sincerely,

Customer: Hi, I’m currently following the "Intermediate Strength 12-week Plan" on FitApp, but I’m finding it too challenging. By week 3 the workouts have gotten really hard for me – I’m extremely sore and struggling to keep up. Is there a way to switch to a beginner plan without losing all my progress? I’ve completed 2 weeks and don’t want to throw that data away. Or can the plan be adjusted to be a bit easier? Please advise. Thank you,
Mariana Support: Hello Mariana, It’s great that you’re listening to your body – workout plans sometimes need adjusting. You have a couple of options in FitApp:
Switch to a Beginner Plan: You can change your plan from Intermediate to Beginner. To do this, go to Programs > My Current Plan > Options (…) and select Change Plan. Choose a beginner-level plan (for example, "Beginner Strength 12-week"). The app will warn you that you're ending the current plan, but don't worry – your completed workouts (the 2 weeks you did) will still be saved in your history. They just won't count toward the new plan’s progress since that's a fresh start.
Adjust Current Plan Intensity: Alternatively, if you want to stay in the current plan, you might consider swapping out some exercises or adding extra rest days. For instance, you could use the app’s Schedule Editor to spread week 3 over two weeks, giving yourself more recovery time. You can drag and drop workouts on the in-app calendar to rearrange them.
If you switch to a beginner plan, you’ll still have all your past workout logs in the History section, so none of that data is lost – it just won't be tied to the new plan’s progress tracker. And if you ever feel the beginner plan is too easy, you can always ramp up again later. I hope that helps! Let me know if you need guidance on using the Schedule Editor or anything else. We want to ensure you have a routine that fits you and keeps you motivated. Best of luck with your training,

Customer: Hi team, I’ll be traveling all of next week and won’t be able to follow my workout schedule from April 20-27. I’m in the middle of the "5K Training Plan". Is there a way to pause or shift the schedule in FitApp so I don’t mess up the plan? I’d like to basically skip that week and pick up where I left off when I return. Appreciate your help,
Talya Support: Hi Talya, Enjoy your travels! We can certainly adjust your 5K Training Plan to accommodate your break. Here are a couple of ways to handle it:
Use the Plan Pause Feature: FitApp has a built-in plan pause. Go to your 5K Training Plan overview, tap the Options (…) menu, and select “Pause Plan.” You can specify the dates (April 20–27) to pause. The app will automatically extend your plan end date by a week and shift all scheduled workouts forward by that amount.
Manual Schedule Adjustments: Alternatively, you can manually move next week’s workouts to future dates. In the Calendar view, drag each workout from April 20–27 and drop them onto the following week. This achieves the same effect, just manually.
With either method, you won't lose any progress. When you resume, the plan will continue with the next workout where you left off (your week 4 will effectively happen when you're back). Just remember to un-pause the plan when you’re ready to start exercising again. The app should prompt you, or you can go back to the plan options and resume. I hope that helps. Safe travels, and good luck with your training when you return! If you need anything else, let us know. Best,
Connor

Customer: Hi, I’ve been loving the personalized meal plans in FitApp, but I have a dietary issue. I’m lactose intolerant, yet this week’s meal plan includes a yogurt parfait for breakfast and a cheese snack in the afternoon. I noted in my profile that I avoid dairy, so I’m not sure why these came up. Is there a way to adjust my meal plan to exclude dairy (and ideally other preferences like making it vegetarian-friendly)? Thanks,
Sneha Support: Hello Sneha, Thank you for bringing this to our attention and I’m glad you’re enjoying the meal plans (aside from the dairy issue!). There are a couple of things we can do:
Profile Dietary Preferences: First, double-check your dietary settings. In the app, go to Profile > Dietary Preferences. You should see options to mark Lactose Intolerant or Dairy-Free, Vegetarian, etc. Make sure "Dairy-Free" is checked and any other preferences (like Vegetarian) are set correctly. Sometimes an app update can reset these settings, so it's good to reconfirm.
Plan Regeneration: Once your preferences are correctly set, you can regenerate this week’s plan. In the Meal Plan section, tap the Refresh/Regenerate Plan option. It will create a new set of meals taking into account your updated preferences. This should swap out the yogurt parfait and cheese snack for dairy-free alternatives (likely something like a chia pudding or a fruit smoothie for breakfast, and nuts or a veggie snack in place of cheese).
If after doing this you still see dairy or any other unwanted items, please let me know. It might be a bug in our meal planning algorithm and we’ll investigate further. Additionally, you can always manually swap any single meal by tapping on it and choosing "Replace Meal" – the app will suggest an alternative from our database (which respects your preferences). Sorry for the inconvenience. We want to ensure the plan truly fits your needs. Let us know if this resolves the issue or if you need more help tweaking the plan! Sincerely,
Tom

Customer: Hello, my husband and I both want to use FitApp. Is there a family plan available? Or can we share one Premium subscription between the two of us if we use the same login? We want to track our workouts separately but paying for two full subscriptions is a bit pricey for one household. Any recommendations? Thanks,
Hannah Support: Hi Hannah, Thank you for reaching out. At the moment, we do not have a family plan and each FitApp account requires its own subscription for Premium features. Sharing one login between two people is not recommended because:
The app tailors workout plans and nutrition guidance to an individual’s stats and progress, so using one account for two people would mix up data (which could make the recommendations inaccurate for both of you).
It would also cause issues like one person’s workouts overriding the other's records, etc.
We understand the cost concern. While we don't offer a family bundle yet, it’s something we’ve discussed as a team because we know couples and families like to work out together. I’ll definitely note your interest in a family plan to our product team. In the meantime, we do occasionally provide discount codes for second subscriptions. I can offer you a 50% off code for one month for your husband's account to help you get started (Code: SECONDUSER50). Also, keep an eye on our newsletters; we sometimes run promotions around New Year or summer. Sorry that we don’t have a perfect solution right now. We appreciate you and your husband using FitApp, and we hope to support multiple users under one plan in the future. If you have any other questions or need help setting up the second account, please let me know. Best regards,
Danielle

Customer: Hi, I have some feedback for you guys. The progress graphs on the dashboard (like the weight trend and weekly workout graph) are a bit hard to read. The text labels and numbers are pretty small on my phone (Google Pixel 5), and the light blue color is difficult to see against the white background. Not an urgent issue, but it would be great if you could make the graphs more readable – maybe larger text or a darker color scheme for the lines. Thanks for an otherwise awesome app,
Zach Support: Hi Zach, Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback. We really appreciate users like you who help us improve FitApp. You make a good point about the progress graphs – readability is crucial, and we want you to easily see your achievements! I’ve passed your suggestions about larger text and higher-contrast colors on to our design and UX team. In fact, we’re exploring a few improvements:
Implementing pinch-to-zoom on graphs, so you can zoom in to see details.
Darkening the graph lines and increasing font size for labels, especially on mobile displays.
As you and others have suggested, our upcoming dark mode (in development) will also provide an alternative color scheme that should be easier on the eyes.
While I can’t give an exact timeline, enhancements to the dashboard graphs are on our roadmap. Your feedback helps prioritize this kind of update. I'm glad to hear you find the app awesome aside from that issue. If you notice anything else or have further ideas, please feel free to reach out anytime. Thanks again for helping us make FitApp better! Best,
Helen

Customer: Hi Support, I just finished the "Marathon Prep" program and expected to get the finisher badge for it, but it didn’t unlock in my Achievements. I completed all 12 weeks (the app shows 100% complete for the program) as of yesterday. The achievement badge "Marathoner" is still grayed out in the app. Can you help unlock it or tell me what I might be missing? Thanks,
Raj Support: Hello Raj, First off, congratulations on finishing the 12-week Marathon Prep program – that’s a big accomplishment! You definitely should get that "Marathoner" achievement badge. If it's still grayed out, it sounds like you've hit a glitch rather than missing anything. I’ve seen this happen once or twice where the system doesn’t immediately grant the badge upon completion. I've manually triggered the achievement on your account just now, so if you refresh the app (or log out and back in), you should see the Marathoner badge unlocked in your Achievements section. Also, just so you know, our development team is aware of this occasional hiccup and is working on a fix to ensure badges unlock automatically. It's important to us that your hard work is recognized without delay! Sorry for the inconvenience. You should see that shiny new badge now. If it's still not showing up or if you have any other questions, please let me know. And again, great job on completing the program! Sincerely,
Elena

Customer: Hello, I'd like to keep a personal backup of all my workout data. Is there a way to export my FitApp data (exercises, dates, maybe calories and notes) to a file like CSV or PDF? I just want to have a copy outside the app for my records. Please advise if this is possible. Thank you,
Lucy Support: Hi Lucy, Great question – keeping a personal copy of your fitness data is a smart idea. FitApp does offer a way to export your workout data:
On the Web Dashboard (http://fitapp.com – log in with your account), go to the History or Workouts section.
There’s an Export Data button on the top right. Clicking that will give you options to download your data as a CSV file.
The CSV will include fields like date, workout name, duration, calories burned, and any notes you entered for each session.
If you primarily use the mobile app and haven't used our web dashboard before, don't worry – your data is synced, so you'll find all your workouts there once you log in. In case you prefer a PDF summary or run into any issues with the above, let me know. We can generate a report for you manually and email it to you in your preferred format. We’re also working on adding the export option directly into the mobile app in a future update for convenience. Let me know if you need any further assistance. I'm happy to help! Best regards,

Customer: Hi, I'm not receiving the daily workout reminder notifications from FitApp anymore. I have the reminder set for 7:00 AM each day, and it used to work, but for the last week I've gotten nothing. I checked that notifications are enabled in the app settings. My phone (iPhone 13, iOS 16) has notifications enabled for FitApp as well. Other app notifications are coming through fine. Can you help me figure out why the reminders stopped? Thanks,
Stephanie Support: Hi Stephanie, Sorry to hear the notifications aren't coming through – those reminders can be really helpful. You’ve already checked the key settings, so let's try a few more troubleshooting steps:
Re-enable Notifications: In the FitApp app, toggle the daily reminder off and then back on (maybe set it to a new time, say 7:05 AM, as a test). Sometimes re-saving the setting can kick-start the schedule.
Check iOS Focus/Do Not Disturb: Ensure that no Focus mode or Do Not Disturb setting is active at 7:00 AM on your iPhone, which might silence notifications.
Background App Refresh: Make sure FitApp is allowed to run in the background. On iOS, go to Settings > FitApp, and verify that Background App Refresh is enabled. The app needs background access to send scheduled notifications.
Reinstall (if needed): If the above don't work, try logging out of FitApp, uninstalling the app, and then reinstalling it from the App Store. After reinstalling, log in and set the reminder again. This often resolves any glitch if the notification service got hung up.
I've checked our system and there's no widespread issue with notifications this week, so it does seem specific to the device or app settings. Please try these steps and let me know if your 7:00 AM alert tomorrow comes through. If it still doesn't work, we'll dig deeper. We want to make sure you get those daily nudges! Best,

Customer: Hi, I live in the UK and my FitApp is all in English (which is fine), but I'm curious if there's a way to change the app language to Spanish. My workout buddy uses FitApp in Spain and his app is in Spanish. Also, I noticed the app shows some measurements in miles even though we use kilometers here – for instance, the cardio section gave me a target run of 3 miles instead of 5 km. Is there a setting to adjust language and units beyond what I’ve already set? Cheers,
Miguel Support: Hello Miguel, Currently, FitApp is available in several languages, including Spanish. The app typically defaults to the device's language if supported. If your phone’s language is set to English (UK), the app will show English. To use FitApp in Spanish, you have two options:
Change your device language to Spanish (which will turn the app to Spanish, but of course this affects your whole phone).
(Upcoming Feature): We're working on an in-app language selector. It's not available just yet, but it's on the way in a future update to let you switch languages without changing your device settings.
As for the units: FitApp should indeed respect your unit settings. If you set your preference to metric, runs should display in kilometers. It sounds like the 3 miles vs 5 km might be a slight oversight or a default in that particular training plan. To fix this:
Double-check in Profile > Units that it's set to Metric (which I suspect you have done).
If it is, the plan's text might not have converted. I'll report this to our content team. In the meantime, you can interpret it as roughly 5 km. The tracking itself will record in kilometers if you run with the app.
Also, ensure your timezone and region are correct under your phone settings. Sometimes region can subtly affect how units are shown.
So, short answer: full Spanish support is there (through device language, until we add the manual option), and the units should be kilometers – we'll get that specific plan corrected. Thanks for flagging it! Let me know if you need help with anything else. Saludos,

Customer: Hi, I referred my friend to FitApp using my referral code TONYFRIEND25. He signed up for a yearly subscription on March 20, 2025, which should qualify me for a referral reward (I think it was one free month?). However, I haven’t seen any free month credited to my account yet. Can you check if everything went through? My username is TonyFit88 and my friend’s email is friend@example.com. Thanks,
Tony Support: Hi Tony, Congrats on getting your friend to join FitApp, and thanks for spreading the word! I’ve looked up our referral logs:
I do see that your friend used your code TONYFRIEND25 when signing up on March 20, 2025.
The referral program grants the free month after the referred friend remains subscribed beyond the trial period. Your friend’s free trial ended on April 3, and their paid subscription started on April 4.
You are absolutely eligible for a free month of Premium. It looks like it should have been applied on April 4, but there was a glitch that prevented the automatic credit. I've now manually credited your account with one free month. This means your next billing date has been pushed out by one month (you can verify this in your subscription settings). You won’t be charged for the coming month. Sorry for the oversight! We’re also fixing the issue to ensure future referral rewards apply without manual intervention. Thank you again for referring a friend. If you have any more questions or if something looks off with your billing now, please let me know. Cheers,

Customer: Hello, I often work out in a basement gym with no Wi-Fi or cellular signal, and I've noticed FitApp struggles to function offline. Sometimes I can't view my next workout because it tries (and fails) to fetch something from the server, and I even got logged out once when I had no internet. Does FitApp have an offline mode or any plan to support offline usage? It's frustrating not being able to see my routine just because I'm offline. Thanks,
Adrian Support: Hi Adrian, You raise a great point. FitApp does cache some data for offline use, but it's true that our app currently performs best with an internet connection. We don't want you to be stuck in the middle of a workout, so here's what you can do and what we’re working on:
Preload Workouts: Before you head to your basement gym, open the app while you still have connection and load up the day's workout (open the workout details, maybe even start it). The app should cache the exercise list and info. You can then go offline and still swipe through that workout. In offline mode, the app should let you log sets/reps and will sync them to the server next time you have connection.
Login Issue: Getting logged out offline is not intended. The app should keep you signed in. That might have been a bug – possibly if the app tried to verify your session and failed. I'll flag that to our engineers as it's definitely not user-friendly.
Upcoming Offline Mode: The good news is an improved offline mode is on our roadmap. The team is working on allowing the entire week’s plan to be accessible offline once you've opened the app online. This way, if you know you'll be without internet, you can just open the app at home first and then you’re set.
I apologize for the inconvenience. For now, try the preload trick and it should mitigate the problem. And rest assured, better offline support is coming in a future update. Let me know if you have any other questions or if there's any part of your routine we can help accommodate. Best,
Josh

Customer: Hi, I'm having trouble with the exercise demo videos in the app. None of the videos are playing for me – I just see the loading spinner icon continuously. My internet connection is strong (I tried on both Wi-Fi and 5G). I’m using a Google Pixel 6 with Android 12, FitApp version 4.0. Is there a known issue with video playback? It's hard to follow some exercises without those demo videos. Thanks,
Eva Support: Hello Eva, Sorry about the trouble with the exercise videos. They are definitely important for guidance, so let's figure out why they're not loading:
We don’t have a widespread outage of videos at the moment, so this might be device-specific. First, try clearing the FitApp cache: go to Settings > Apps > FitApp > Storage and tap Clear Cache. This can help if a cached video file is stuck.
Also, ensure you’re on the latest version (v4.0 is a few months old now; the current is 4.2). If possible, update the app to the latest version from the Play Store – we made some improvements to video loading in recent updates.
Another thing: occasionally, a firewall or DNS issue can cause videos (which stream from our content delivery network) to hang. If you have any VPN or data saver on, try disabling that and see if it makes a difference.
If none of these help and the spinner persists, please let me know. We might need to gather more details or logs to see what’s happening. On rare occasions, a particular phone model might have a codec issue with our videos; if that's the case, our team will work on a fix or alternate encoding. Meanwhile, as a workaround, remember you can tap the "View Steps" text below the video area to see a written description of the exercise steps. Not as good as the video, I know, but it can help ensure you maintain form until we resolve the video playback problem. I’ll be standing by for your update on whether the issue persists after trying the above. We want to get you back to seamless workouts! Regards,

Customer: Hi, I’m using FitApp on an older Android phone (LG G6 running Android 8.0). The app has been very slow lately and it crashes sometimes, plus I saw that I cannot update to the latest version because it's not compatible with my device. Is there a lightweight version of the app or a way I can continue using FitApp without buying a new phone? I also have a laptop; is there a web version I could use instead? Thanks,
Linda Support: Hi Linda, We do try to support older devices as long as we can, but sometimes newer versions of the app require more recent Android OS versions. FitApp's latest update now requires Android 9.0 or above, which is why you’re unable to update on your LG G6 with Android 8.0. Here are a few suggestions:
Web App: Yes, we have a web version! You can log in at fitapp.com on your laptop’s browser. It lets you track workouts, view plans, and log nutrition. While it’s not as portable as your phone, it’s a full-featured alternative and might actually be faster given your phone’s limitations.
Older App Version: You can continue using the older version of FitApp that’s installed on your phone. It should still log workouts, but some newer features might not work perfectly, and unfortunately you might continue to see some slowness or occasional crashes due to limited device memory.
Data Sync: All your data is synced to our servers, so whether you use the web or your phone, your progress will stay up-to-date across both. If you do eventually switch to a newer phone, just log in and everything will be there.
We don’t have a "lite" version of the app, but using the web interface for detailed tasks and the phone for just quick logs might ease the load on your device. I know upgrading a phone is a big ask just for an app. We aim to optimize FitApp to run as efficiently as possible, even on older hardware. I’ll pass along your experience to our development team so they know there's demand for continued support on older Android versions. If you run into any specific issues using the web version or the old app, let me know and I can assist further. Thank you for sticking with FitApp! Sincerely,
Ankit

Customer: Hi, I signed up for FitApp on my phone using "Sign in with Google". Now I’m trying to log in on the FitApp website, but it keeps saying my password is incorrect (I realized I never set a password because of Google sign-in). I ended up accidentally creating a second account with the same email when I tried the "Forgot Password" on the website. Now I'm confused – how do I access my original account on the web? My Google-linked account email is samir.khan@gmail.com. Regards,
Samir Support: Hello Samir, I understand the confusion; the Google Sign-In process can cause this scenario. Here's how we can sort it out:
To access your original account on the website, you should use the "Continue with Google" option on the web login page, not the email/password fields. This will authenticate you via Google and log you into the correct account (the one with all your data).
The "Forgot Password" you tried actually created a separate account because your Google-linked account didn't have a local password set. I've gone ahead and removed that accidental secondary account to avoid further confusion.
If you prefer to have a password for your Google-linked account (so you can log in with email/password in the future), you can set one up:
Log in to FitApp on the web by clicking "Continue with Google".
Once logged in, go to Account Settings and choose the option to set a password for your account. You might find it under Security or Login Preferences.
After setting a password, you'll be able to log in with your email (samir.khan@gmail.com) and that password on any device, as an alternative to Google Sign-In.
But this is optional – you can always just use the Google button on any platform (web or mobile) to access your account. Sorry for the confusion with the accounts. The key is to always choose the Google login method if that’s how the account was created. If you have any trouble logging in after this or any other questions, please let me know. I’m happy to help! Best,

Customer: Hi, my annual subscription is up for renewal on June 10, 2025. I need an invoice or receipt for this subscription payment to submit to my employer’s wellness reimbursement program. How can I get a formal invoice for the renewal? Also, will I get any notification before the card is charged on June 10? I just want to make sure I don't miss it. Thank you,
Brandon Support: Hi Brandon, We can definitely help you with the invoice and information about your upcoming renewal:
Invoice/Receipt: Typically, when your subscription renews on June 10, you'll automatically receive an email receipt from us (or from the App Store/Play Store if you subscribed through them) detailing the charge. If you need a formal invoice in advance, I can generate one for the upcoming renewal now. It will include your name, the service (FitApp Premium Annual), the amount ($59.99), and the renewal date. Would you like me to send that to you in PDF format?
Renewal Notification: We send a reminder email about annual renewals 7 days before the charge. So you should receive a notification around June 3, 2025 reminding you of the upcoming renewal. This gives you time to update payment info or cancel if needed. Since you intend to keep it for reimbursement, you can simply let it renew.
Just to note, if you subscribed via the App Store or Google Play, their system sends the receipts and sometimes those can be retrieved from your Apple ID or Google account purchase history as well. But either way, I’ll be happy to make sure you get what you need. Let me know if you want that PDF invoice now or if the standard receipt upon renewal will suffice. And if you have any other questions or need adjustments to your billing information, I'm here to assist. Regards,

Customer: Hey FitApp team, I'm part of the beta testing group and just updated to the beta version 5.0b (build 2025.04.01). The new custom workout builder feature looks awesome, but I encountered a problem: the app crashes every time I try to save a custom workout routine. It lets me add exercises and configure them, but as soon as I hit "Save", the app freezes and then closes. I figure this is because it's a beta, but I wanted to let you know. Is there a specific place I should report beta bugs? Also, happy to send any logs if you tell me how. Cheers,
Alexis Support: Hi Alexis, Thanks for reaching out and for testing the beta – we really appreciate your help in polishing new features. The custom workout builder is indeed in beta, and it looks like you've hit a known bug we're working on. We’ve identified the crash on “Save” and already have a fix implemented internally. We plan to push an updated beta (5.0b2) by the end of this week that addresses this issue. In the meantime, unfortunately, creating new custom routines will crash the app, so hold off on that until the update. For beta feedback and bug reports, you have a couple of options:
In-App Beta Feedback: If you’re on iOS TestFlight, you can send feedback directly through TestFlight (there’s an option to send logs and comments). On Android, if you joined via the Play Store Beta, you can email us or use the in-app “Report a Problem” button.
Email: The way you did it now works great too. We have a dedicated beta support email (beta@fitapp.com) which goes directly to our QA team, but I can forward this info for you.
If you have any crash logs, on iOS you can find them in Analytics Data, or on Android in the device logcat. But no worries if that's too technical – we've gathered enough reports to pinpoint this bug. Thanks again for testing and reporting! We're excited about the workout builder too and want to get it running smoothly for you. I’ll let you know when the new beta build is out. Any other feedback or ideas you have, feel free to share. Best,

Customer: Hi FitApp team, I just wanted to say I’m really enjoying the app! I've lost 10 pounds since January and am feeling great, thanks to the workout programs and meal guidance. Keep up the good work! I do have one quick question: Is there a way to manually add a workout? Sometimes I do a sport or activity that’s not in the app (like a weekend hike or a yoga class at my gym). I want to log those calories and time so they count toward my weekly activity. If this feature isn’t there, consider it a feature request. 😃 Thanks again,
Dan Support: Hi Dan, First off, congratulations on the 10 pounds down – that's fantastic progress! 🎉 We love hearing stories like yours, and we're thrilled that FitApp has been a helpful part of your journey. Thank you for the kind words; it truly motivates our team. Now, about your question: yes, you can manually add workouts that aren't part of the built-in programs. Here's how:
Go to the Workouts tab and look for a "+" or Add Workout button (usually in the upper right corner).
Select "Log a Workout Manually" (on some versions it might just say "Manual Entry").
You'll be able to enter details like the type of activity (you can choose something general like "Other" or "Hiking"), duration, and estimated calories burned.
Save it, and it will count toward your daily and weekly totals just like any other workout. It will also appear in your history.
We definitely want you to get credit for all that hard work, even if it's outside of our preset exercises. And your suggestion is noted – we're always expanding our list of activities. In fact, yoga is already in the app (you can log it as a workout type), and we're looking to add more outdoor activities like hiking as distinct options. Thanks again for reaching out with positive feedback and the question. If you have any more ideas or need help with anything, feel free to email us anytime. We're rooting for your continued success! Best,

Customer: Hi, I'm a bit confused about the content in the app. I'm a Premium subscriber already, but I saw something called the "Yoga Expansion Pack" in the app's Discover section for $4.99. Do I need to purchase this separately? I assumed my subscription covers all features and content. What does the Yoga Pack include, and is it not part of the regular Premium plan? Thanks,
Vanessa Support: Hello Vanessa, Great question – I can clarify that for you. FitApp Premium does include the vast majority of our content: all the standard workout programs, meal plans, tracking features, etc. The "Yoga Expansion Pack" you saw is an optional add-on program created in partnership with a guest yoga instructor. Here's the breakdown:
The Yoga Pack is a specialty 8-week yoga program with video classes that were not part of the original Premium content library. It's a one-time purchase for lifetime access to those particular classes.
As a Premium subscriber, you already have access to our basic yoga workouts and some yoga routines in the app. The Expansion Pack is just extra content (think of it like a special course) for users who want more in-depth yoga sessions.
You are not required to buy it to enjoy FitApp. It's entirely optional. Many users skip it, and many yoga enthusiasts choose to buy it to supplement their training.
We occasionally offer these add-on packs (like a Marathon Training plan or Nutrition recipe bundles) for users with specific interests. But rest assured, your Premium subscription covers everything you need for a complete fitness experience. The add-ons are just bonus content if you want something very specific. I hope that clears up the confusion. If you have zero interest in the Yoga Pack, feel free to ignore it – your app will continue to work perfectly without it. If you do love yoga and decide to get it, it's a one-time fee and then it's yours permanently (even if you ever paused your subscription, you'd keep access to purchased packs). Let me know if you have any other questions about this or any other feature of the app. I'm happy to help! Sincerely,
Clara

Customer: Hi, something frustrating happened today. I finished a 45-minute workout (HIIT session) around 6:30 PM, but when I hit save, the app froze and eventually crashed. When I reopened FitApp, it was as if I never did the workout – it’s not in my history, and my daily calories burned reset. This also broke my 8-day workout streak which I'm really upset about. Is there any way to recover that workout data or at least manually log it so my streak stays intact? I remember most of the details (approx 300 calories, etc.). Thanks,
Umar Support: Hi Umar, I'm really sorry to hear about the app crash – I know how disheartening it can be to lose a logged workout, especially when you're keeping a streak. Let's see how we can fix this:
Manual Entry: Since you remember the details, you can manually log the workout to restore your records. Go to the Workouts tab and tap Add Workout > Log Manually. Enter the date (make sure to set it to today’s date and approximate time), the type of workout (HIIT, in this case), duration (45 minutes), and an estimate of 300 calories burned. Once saved, it will appear in your history and count toward your streak.
I've taken the liberty to check your account and, to ensure your 8-day streak remains unbroken, I've adjusted our backend logs. Your streak should now correctly show 9 days (including today) after you add that manual entry. If it doesn’t update immediately, try pulling down on the History screen to refresh.
Crash Issue: We're investigating why the app froze at the save step. It could be a memory issue or a rare bug. Our team will look into the crash reports around 6:30 PM today for your device model. In the meantime, I'd recommend keeping the app updated to the latest version, and perhaps reboot your phone regularly if you do long sessions (just as a general precaution to clear memory).
I know it’s not the same as having it work perfectly the first time, but I hope these steps help you regain your streak and log. You’re doing great with your consistency – 8 (now 9) days in a row is awesome! If the manual entry doesn't reflect properly or you need any more help, please let me know and I'll make sure it gets sorted out. Apologies again for the trouble, and happy training! Best,

Customer: Hi, I'm curious about how FitApp calculates calories burned for workouts. For example, it shows I burn about 300 calories for a 30-minute weight lifting session. I'm 180 lbs (about 82 kg). Is the app using my weight and the type of exercise to estimate this? Sometimes it seems a bit high compared to what gym machines tell me. Can I adjust it to make it more accurate for me, or is it a fixed formula? Thanks,
Matt Support: Hello Matt, Great question – a lot of users wonder about the calorie estimates. FitApp calculates calories using a combination of your personal data and known metabolic equivalents (METs) for each activity:
We take into account your weight (which you entered in your profile) because calorie burn is heavily influenced by body mass – heavier individuals burn more calories doing the same activity as lighter individuals, generally.
Each exercise or workout type has an assigned intensity value (MET). For weight lifting, let's say the MET value might be around 6 (just as an example). The app uses a formula: Calories = MET * weight (kg) * duration (hours) and then applies some adjustments.
So for you at 82 kg, 30 minutes (0.5 hours) of moderate weight lifting: 6 * 82 * 0.5 ≈ 246 calories. The app might be giving ~300 if it assumes a slightly higher intensity or includes some afterburn effect, etc.
It's an estimate, of course. Gym machines often use similar calculations but can vary in accuracy. If you feel the app is consistently overestimating for you, there's a couple of things you can do:
Make sure your weight is updated correctly in the app. If you've lost weight recently, update it, as that will reduce calorie estimates accordingly.
If you use a heart rate monitor or fitness tracker that syncs with FitApp (like via Apple Health, Google Fit, or Fitbit), the app can use that data to refine calorie estimates for cardio especially.
Unfortunately, there's no manual "adjustment slider" for calories in the app, but you can always log a custom calorie burn if you know the exact value (though that's more work and not usually necessary).
Overall, take the calorie readouts as a ballpark figure. They're useful for relative tracking (comparing your sessions to each other) even if they might not be 100% precise. If you need very accurate calorie burn info, pairing with a heart rate sensor during workouts can help. I hope this explanation helps. Let me know if you have any other questions about how FitApp works – happy to clarify! Best,

Customer: Hi, does FitApp track daily steps or general activity outside of workouts? I carry my phone all day and it counts steps (I have Google Fit on my Android). It would be great if FitApp could import that data or at least show total daily calorie burn including routine activity, not just workouts. Is that possible? Thanks,
Ben Support: Hi Ben, FitApp primarily focuses on intentional exercise and nutrition, but you're right that daily activity is an important part of overall fitness. Currently, FitApp itself doesn’t count your daily steps by default, but we do have integration options:
Google Fit Integration (Android): Since you have Google Fit, you can connect it to FitApp. In FitApp, go to Settings > Connect to Google Fit. This will allow FitApp to read your step count and basic activity data from Google Fit. Once connected, you should start seeing your step count for the day within the FitApp dashboard (there's a daily activity widget that appears when an integration is active).
After connecting, FitApp will use your Google Fit data to show a more comprehensive daily calorie burn (combining your workout calories and your active calories from steps).
Do note, our team is working on making daily activity tracking a more prominent feature in the future, possibly including in-app step tracking for those not using Google Fit or Apple Health. For now, linking to Google Fit is the best way to incorporate your everyday activity. Give that a try, and if you run into any trouble setting it up, just let us know. Hope that helps you get a fuller picture of your daily burn! Any more questions, feel free to ask. Best,

Customer: Hello, I use MyFitnessPal to track my food. Is there a way to sync my calorie or meal data between FitApp and MyFitnessPal? It'd be ideal if the calories or meals I log in one app show up in the other, so I don't have to enter everything twice. If direct integration isn't available, do you have any workarounds or plans to add it? Thanks,
Aaron Support: Hi Aaron, This is a great question and one we hear often. Currently, FitApp doesn’t have a direct integration with MyFitnessPal (MFP). The two apps operate in separate ecosystems, so food entries in one won't automatically appear in the other. However, here are a couple of points and tips:
Indirect Sync via Apple Health/Google Fit: If you are on iOS and you link both FitApp and MFP to Apple Health, FitApp can write your calorie data to Apple Health and MFP can read total calories from Apple Health (or vice versa). On Android, Google Fit can do something similar with calorie expenditure, but not meals. This isn’t a full sync of detailed meal data, but it can keep your total calories in sync between apps.
Export/Import: Another workaround some users do is periodically export a log from one app and manually input summary data into the other. For example, at end of day, take the total calories or macros from MFP and enter a quick summary in FitApp’s nutrition section. I know that’s not ideal, but it's a stopgap if needed.
Future Plans: We recognize that MFP is very popular and integrating would be helpful. While I can't promise anything soon, our team has noted the request. We are focusing first on improving integrations with Apple Health and Google Fit, since they act as hubs for many apps.
I also want to mention that FitApp’s own nutrition tracker is continually improving. If there are specific features from MyFitnessPal that you love, let us know – we might be able to incorporate similar ideas down the road. Sorry there's no direct link at the moment. We’ll keep striving to make tracking as seamless as possible. If you have any other questions or suggestions, I'd be happy to hear them! Best regards,

Customer: Hi, I signed up for the Premium Plus plan that includes a personal coach about 10 days ago. I was assigned a coach named Alex H. The app said I'd get a welcome message from my coach, but I haven’t heard anything yet (no message or email). I'm eager to start my personalized training with them. How do the communications normally work, and can you check if something's wrong? I want to make sure I didn’t miss anything from Coach Alex. Thanks,
Isabella Support: Hello Isabella, Congratulations on joining our coaching program – we're excited to have you on board! I apologize that you haven't been contacted by your coach yet. You definitely should have received a welcome message within 1-2 days. It sounds like something might have been missed. I've looked into your account and see that Coach Alex H. was indeed assigned to you on April 1. There was a welcome email drafted on April 2, but it appears it never left our outbox due to a technical glitch. I'm very sorry about that oversight. I've just notified Alex about the issue, and he will be reaching out to you within the next few hours. Expect a message in the app's Messages/Coach tab (and an email copy of it). In that message, Alex will introduce himself and likely ask you some questions about your goals, schedule a kickoff call or chat, etc. In general, communication with your coach happens in-app (under the Coach or Messages section). You should also get email notifications when a new message arrives. If you prefer phone or video call check-ins, you can arrange that with Alex as well – our coaches are flexible in communicating via the app chat, email, or scheduled calls, whichever you prefer. We take this slip-up seriously. To make up for the delay, I'm extending your coaching plan by an extra week at no cost, so you get the full duration of guidance you paid for. Thank you for your patience, and I'm confident Alex will get you on track right away. If you don't hear from him by end of day, or if you have any other concerns, please let me know and I'll personally ensure you're connected. Sincerely,
Steven

Customer: Hello, I accidentally ended up with two FitApp accounts. One is under my personal email (grace89@example.com) which has all my workout history from the trial, and another under my work email (grace@workmail.com) which I unfortunately used to purchase the annual subscription. I’d like to consolidate to just my personal email account with all my data, and have the subscription applied to that one. Is it possible to transfer my subscription to my personal account or merge the two accounts? Thank you,
Grace Support: Hi Grace, Thanks for explaining the situation – it happens more often than you'd think, and we can help sort it out. Here’s what we can do:
I've verified the two accounts: grace89@example.com (with your workout history and trial) and grace@workmail.com (which has the active annual subscription started on April 5, 2025).
We cannot directly "merge" account data automatically, but we can certainly transfer your subscription and assist in moving your data.
What I will do:
Transfer Subscription: I’ve canceled the subscription on the work email account (grace@workmail.com) effective immediately, and initiated a transfer of the remaining subscription period to your personal account. This means your personal account (grace89@example.com) is now set to Premium and will expire on April 4, 2026, the same date the original annual would have ended. You will not be double-charged; it's simply moving the paid time over.
Combine Data: Your workout history is already on the personal account, so that’s good. If there is any data on the work account (for example, if you logged something there in the interim), let me know. We can manually import those few entries to your personal account if needed. From what I see, the work account only has a profile created but no workouts logged.
Next steps for you:
Log into FitApp using your personal email (grace89@example.com). You should see that you have Premium features now active.
Please confirm that all your historical data looks intact. It should, since we didn't delete that account or anything.
You can go ahead and discontinue using the work email account entirely. Perhaps log out from any device where it might be logged in, to avoid confusion.
I'm glad we could resolve this. Please verify that everything looks correct on your end. If anything is missing or if you have further questions, just let me know. We're here to help. Best,
Tim

Customer: Hi, my subscription renewal failed yesterday (April 10) because my credit card expired. I updated my card info today and my account is Premium again, but I'm concerned: did I lose anything during the lapse? My workout plan was locked for a day – did that pause my progress or streak? And will I be charged for the gap day or does my new cycle start from the original renewal date? Thanks,
Julia Support: Hi Julia, Great job on quickly updating your payment info. I can clarify what happened and put your mind at ease:
Data and Progress: You did not lose any data or progress. When the payment failed on April 10, your account temporarily reverted to free Basic status, which is why the plan showed as locked. However, all your workout history and plan progress were saved on our servers. Now that you've reactivated Premium (with the new card), everything should be accessible exactly where you left off. Your current training plan will continue – it might appear as if you "missed" a day if you couldn’t log a workout yesterday, but you can just continue from today. If you kept your streak by doing a workout offline, feel free to log it now that Premium is back (to keep your streak count).
Billing and Cycle: Since you updated the card on April 11, we charged the new card on that date to cover your renewal. Your new billing cycle will still be based on the original renewal date; effectively, you paid one day later than planned, but we've extended your subscription to cover a full period. So if it was a monthly renewal due April 10, your next renewal will be May 10 (not May 11). We basically provided Premium on April 10 despite the lapse, and didn't penalize you for that day.
I also took the liberty to ensure your streak isn't marked broken due to yesterday. It looks like you had a rest day logged, but if that was unintentional because of the lockout, you can either log a workout for that day or let me know and I can adjust it. Going forward, everything should function normally with the new card. You'll receive a confirmation email for the successful payment. If you have any more concerns about your account or billing, I'm here to help. Welcome back to full access, and happy training! Sincerely,
Ken

Customer: Hi, I have a question about privacy. What data does FitApp collect about me, and do you share it with any third parties? I’m particularly concerned about things like my workout history, dietary information, and personal details. I enjoy the app but want to be sure my data isn’t being sold or misused. Also, is there a way to download all my data or delete it if I ever want to? Thanks,
Julian Support: Hello Julian, We take privacy very seriously, and I'm happy to answer your questions in detail:
Data Collected: FitApp collects data that you provide and generate by using the app – this includes your profile information (like age, weight, etc.), workout history (exercises, duration, etc.), nutrition logs, and app usage metrics. We also collect standard device information (like device type and OS version) to improve app performance.
Data Usage: This data is primarily used to personalize your experience (e.g., to tailor your training plan or give you insights on progress). We also use aggregated, anonymous data to help improve the app (for instance, to see which features are most popular).
Third Parties: We do not sell your personal data to third parties. We share data only in limited contexts:
With service providers that help run our business (for example, our cloud storage provider or email service). They are bound by strict privacy agreements and can’t use your data for anything other than providing services to us.
If you connect to third-party integrations (like syncing to Apple Health or Google Fit), we share data with those services only at your request/connection, and in accordance with their and our privacy settings.
We might share anonymized, aggregated data (e.g., "X% of users run 3x a week") publicly or with partners, but nothing that can identify you personally.
Data Security: All your data is transmitted over secure (encrypted) connections and stored encrypted on our servers. Only authorized personnel (like specific engineers or support when helping you) can access personal data, and even then, it's limited.
Download or Deletion: Yes, you have full control:
If you want a copy of your data, you can request a data export (via Settings > Privacy in the app, or by emailing us). We'll compile all your personal data (workouts, meals, profile info, etc.) and provide it to you, usually within a few days.
If you ever want to delete your data, you can either do so in-app (there's an account deletion option under Privacy Settings) or request us to delete it. Deleting your account will erase all personal data permanently from our servers (in compliance with GDPR and other privacy laws if applicable).
We have a detailed Privacy Policy on our website (fitapp.com/privacy) if you’d like all the specifics, but I hope the above gives you a clear overview. Rest assured, your data is yours – we use it only to serve you and improve the app, and we guard it carefully. Let me know if you have any follow-up questions or if there's anything else I can clarify. Sincerely,
Kate

Customer: Hi, I canceled my FitApp Premium subscription a couple of months ago (it expired at the end of February 2025). I'm thinking of re-subscribing now. Will all my old data (workouts, custom meal plans, etc.) still be there when I resubscribe? I had a lot of saved routines and I don't want to start from scratch. Also, if I resubscribe, can I do it at the same rate I was paying before? Thanks,
Sophie Support: Hi Sophie, Welcome back (almost)! The good news is all your data is preserved. Even after a subscription is canceled, we keep your account data (workouts, saved plans, meal logs, etc.) intact for exactly this reason – so you can pick up where you left off if you return.
Once you resubscribe and regain Premium access, you'll find your old workout routines and custom meal plans still in your account. They might be in an "inactive" state if you ended a program when you left, but you can reactivate or start a new one, and your history will still reflect your past progress.
All your logged workouts and history to date (up to end of Feb 2025) will still be visible in the History section even now on the free version, though some detailed analytics might be hidden until you go Premium again.
Regarding the rate: If you were on a promotional rate earlier, I can check. Typically, when you resubscribe via the app stores, it will be at the current standard pricing (which is $9.99/month or $59.99/year at the moment). If your previous rate was a standard rate, it'll be the same. If it was a special discount that’s no longer offered, let me know what it was and I can see if we can honor it or find a similar deal for you. We do occasionally have loyalty discounts for returning users. The simplest path to re-subscribe is to log in to your account and go to Settings > Subscription and choose the plan you want (monthly or annual). If you encounter any issues reactivating, just reach out and we'll help. We're happy to have you back and hope you continue your progress! Let me know if there's anything else you need or if you have trouble seeing your old data once you resubscribe (you should be all set, though). Best,

Customer: Hi, I use FitApp on my iPhone and iPad. I noticed that whenever I log in on my iPad, it logs me out on my iPhone (and vice versa). Can't I stay logged in on both devices at the same time? I like to check my stats on the iPad at home but still be logged in on my phone during workouts. Is there a device limit or something for one account? Thanks,
Lara Support: Hi Lara, Sorry for the inconvenience – you should be able to stay logged in on multiple devices under one account. We don't have a strict device limit for personal use, and many users do use a phone + tablet combo. What you're describing (being logged out on the other device) is not intended behavior. A couple things could be causing this:
If you were offline or had poor connectivity on one device, and then logged in on another, sometimes the system might think it's a "simultaneous login" anomaly and refresh sessions. It's rare, but it can happen.
We did have a bug a while back that caused sessions to invalidate on the first device when a second device logged in. We believed it was fixed in the recent updates.
First, make sure both your iPhone and iPad are running the latest version of FitApp. If one of them is on an older version, updating might resolve the issue. Next, try this: Log in on your iPhone again, then on your iPad. After that, go back and check the iPhone – if it prompted a re-login, sign in once more. From then on, it ideally should keep both active. I just refreshed your session tokens on our server to try to prevent further auto-logouts. If you still experience the logout issue, please let me know. It's not our policy to restrict your devices (aside from obvious security if someone else tries to use your credentials, which doesn't seem to be the case here). We'll investigate further if it persists, because you absolutely should have the convenience of using both. Thank you for flagging this – we want to make sure it's working as expected. Let us know if everything stabilizes, or if you need further assistance. Best,
Nick

Customer: Hi, I recently canceled my FitApp Premium subscription on May 10 via the app. Could you confirm that it is indeed canceled and that I won't be charged next cycle? Also, do I still have access until the original expiration date? I want to be sure I did it right. Thank you,
Lisa Support: Hello Lisa, I've checked your account and can confirm that your Premium subscription has been canceled as of May 10, 2025. This means:
You will not be charged going forward. Your subscription will not renew on its next billing date.
Since you were on a monthly plan and you've already paid through the current period (which I see runs until May 15, 2025), you will retain Premium access until that date. In other words, you can continue to use all the Premium features until the end of May 15.
On May 16, 2025, your account will revert to the free Basic tier automatically. All your data (workouts, history, plans) will still be saved; you'll just lose access to Premium-only features/content unless you decide to resubscribe in the future.
You should receive an email confirmation of this cancellation as well (it might have already hit your inbox). Keep that for your records. It will state the cancellation date and that no further payments will be taken. We're sorry to see you go and hope you found value in FitApp during your time with us. If you have any feedback on why you canceled or what we could improve, we'd love to hear it. And of course, you're welcome back anytime – your account will be here if you decide to upgrade again. Let me know if you need anything else or have more questions about your account. I'm happy to help. Sincerely,
Anthony
